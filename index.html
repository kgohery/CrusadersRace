              The race will be held on Thursday, June 18th, starting at 7:30. The race starts on the South Docks at Lime Street which is very near to the Samuel Beckett Bridge - that’s the one almost opposite the Convention Centre. From there you will head towards the City Centre all the way to the Matt Talbot bridge which you will cross over to the North Quay. From there you will run all the way down to the 3 Arena where you will loop back down the North Quay again towards the Matt Talbot Bridge. There you will cross the bridge again and back to the South Quay. From there you will run back past the Start line. The Finish line is approx. 500 metres beyond the Start line and you will finish at Sir John Rogerson’s Quay. You are then just a small stroll away from the bag drop area in Grand Canal Square and that well deserved night out!!

              <h5>The Short Answer</h5>
              <p>We, Crusaders Athletic Club, are investing ALL the proceeds from the race into providing much needed sporting facilities within the Docklands Community in Irishtown Stadium. So, money from the community invested back into the community.</p>
              <h5>The Slightly Longer Answer</h5>
              <p>
                The Docklands area is a vibrant and growing area. Indeed the Docklands has been designated as a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) which envisages a large rise of some 25,000 people in both the working and residential population in the Docklands during the next few years as more and companies set up in the area. This will give rise to a requirement for more residential living space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recreation plays a very important role in our lives. All work and no play, Jack!!!  The Docklands area boasts a magnificent sport arena in Irishtown Stadium. There is not only a full 8 lane athletics track but also a fully equipped gym, all-weather 11-a side (which is also used for Tag Rugby), all-weather 5 a side pitches along with shower and changing room facilities all available and open to the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                Crusaders Athletic Club (founded 1942) invested heavily in the construction of Irishtown Stadium in the early 2000’s with the remainder being financed by Dublin City Council (DCC). Crusaders, as a result of this investment, are the anchor tenant in the stadium which is managed by DCC and open to all. The offering of the facilities in Irishtown Stadium to both residents and local companies’ employees has seen our membership grow to 650 members (250 children and 400 adults) in 2015. We thus provide a crucial role in the Docklands community providing a healthy and worthwhile recreational activity to all.
              </p>
              <p>
                Crusaders Athletic Club will use all the proceeds from the event to further enhance the sport facilities in the stadium to cater for the growing demand which will be placed upon the facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                So money from the Community invested back into the Community!! We hope you agree that this is a very worthwhile cause and one where you and many others will directly benefit.
